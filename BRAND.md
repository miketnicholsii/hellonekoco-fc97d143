# NÈKO — Brand Principles

NÈKO is a legitimate creative sandbox — where real work happens, but nothing is promised on demand.

## Core Identity

- NÈKO is a place, not a product.
- No checkout language.
- No packages, plans, tiers, or funnels.
- No promises of availability.
- Calm authority over persuasion.
- Restraint is a feature.

## Voice Guidelines

Buttons should feel like invitations:
- Say hello
- Start a conversation
- See the fields

## Copy Tests

**The Clarity Test**: Does this increase clarity without increasing obligation?

**The Availability Test**: Would someone reasonably think they can "buy" us after reading this?

**The Confidence Test**: Are we explaining this because it's unclear — or because we're nervous?

## One-Line Variations

- "A legitimate place for real work — without a sales funnel."
- "Built seriously. Shared selectively."
- "Not everything needs a package."
- "Real work, at a human pace."
- "This isn't a pitch. It's a place."

## The Compass

Trust comes from clarity, not proof.
