# NÈKO — Brand Principles

NÈKO is a place, not a product.

- No checkout language.
- No packages, plans, tiers, or funnels.
- No promises of availability.
- Calm authority over persuasion.
- Restraint is a feature.

Buttons should feel like invitations:
- Say hello
- Start a conversation
- Read the sandbox note

Trust comes from clarity, not proof.
